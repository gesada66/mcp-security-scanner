# MCP Security Scorecard

A comprehensive security assessment tool for Model Context Protocol (MCP) deployments. This MVP provides weighted risk scoring, prioritised findings, and export capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Start development server on port 3001
npm run dev:3001

# Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
```

## Features

### 🎯 Security Scoring
- **Weighted Risk Assessment**: Critical (10) > High (6) > Medium (3) > Low (1)
- **Environment Multipliers**: Production environments receive 1.25x risk penalty
- **Data Sensitivity**: PII/Financial/Health data adds 1.1x multiplier
- **Context-Aware Scoring**: Dynamic weights based on deployment context via Discovery Wizard
- **Real-time Updates**: Score recalculates as you change environment settings

### 🎨 User Interface
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle theme with the sun/moon icon in the header
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Accessible Motion**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` settings
- **Interactive Components**: Hover effects and smooth transitions

### 📊 Scorecard Components
- **Overall Security Score**: 0-100 scale with visual progress bar
- **Risk Distribution**: Breakdown by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Prioritised Findings**: Sorted by risk weight with remediation guidance
- **Environment Context**: Shows current settings affecting the score

### 🔧 Configuration Options
- **Environment Type**: Development, Staging, Production
- **Data Source**: Switch between different fixture files
- **Data Sensitivity**: None, Internal, PII + Financial, Health
- **Discovery Wizard**: Interactive 5-step questionnaire for deployment context
- **Context Banner**: Visual summary of current security context settings

### 🔍 Discovery Wizard
- **Interactive Questionnaire**: 5-step context configuration process
- **Environment Assessment**: Production, staging, development environments
- **Data Sensitivity**: None, internal, PII, regulated data classification
- **Network Exposure**: Public, private, or hybrid deployment models
- **Authentication**: OIDC/OAuth, mTLS, API keys, or unknown methods
- **Compliance**: SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulatory requirements
- **Conservative Handling**: Unknown answers treated with worst-case assumptions
- **Context Banner**: Visual summary of current security context

### 📤 Export & Sharing
- **Export JSON**: Download complete scorecard as JSON file
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quick sharing with timestamp and metadata
- **Export PDF**: Planned for v1.5 (currently disabled)

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
# Run Playwright E2E tests
npm run e2e
```

Tests verify:
- Scorecard rendering with fixture data
- Environment selector functionality
- Data source switching
- Export controls and clipboard functionality
- Accessibility compliance (≥90 a11y score)

### MCP-driven Acceptance (Playwright MCP)
- We also verify key flows with the MCP Playwright browser (agent-controlled):
  - Home loads, Discovery Wizard opens/closes
  - Manage Targets add/test/edit/delete
  - Navigation: Home → Manage Targets → Back

Note: Standard Playwright CLI is still run for parity.

### Accessibility & Performance (Lighthouse)
```bash
# Accessibility (recommended): runs against a production build on :3000 and saves JSON
npm run a11y:lighthouse

# Performance (prod-only gate): builds prod, starts server, runs Lighthouse, saves JSON
npm run perf:lighthouse
```
Reports:
- Accessibility (dev/prod): `lighthouse-a11y-report-final.json`
- Performance (prod): `lighthouse-perf-report-phase4.json`

Notes:
- Run these from `v0-ui/`.
- For local dev exploration only, you can also run Lighthouse directly:
  - `npx lighthouse http://localhost:3001 --only-categories=accessibility --quiet --chrome-flags='--headless=new' --output=json --output-path=./lighthouse-a11y-report-dev.json`
  - Use this for quick checks; the acceptance gate uses the scripted prod run above (a11y ≥ 90).

### Performance Testing
Performance testing is **required only in preprod/prod environments** and not mandatory for local development or feature branches. This includes:
- Load time measurements
- Animation frame rates
- Memory usage monitoring
- Network request optimization

## Phase 4 — Manage Targets

### What’s new
- Manage Targets page (rename from Configure Servers)
- Targets grid/cards with status badges and actions
- Add/Edit/Delete/Test Connection
- Import/Export targets (JSON, schemaVersion 1)
- Local persistence (IndexedDB) and draft autosave (localStorage)
- Back button (consistent styling) to Scorecard

### How to use
1. Open `http://localhost:3001/manage-targets`.
2. Use + Add Target to create a target; Save persists to IndexedDB.
3. Test updates status to connected (mock in MVP).
4. Import/Export buttons handle JSON portability.
5. Use Back to return to the main Scorecard.

```

## Customisation

### Adding New Security Rules
1. Create YAML files in `rules/` directory
2. Follow the pattern: `mcp-XXX-rule-name.yaml`
3. Include: id, title, severity, rationale, remediation, references

### Modifying Scoring Weights
Edit `lib/scoring.ts`:
```typescript
const DEFAULT_SEVERITY_WEIGHTS: Record<RiskSeverity, number> = {
  critical: 10,  // Adjust these values
  high: 6,
  medium: 3,
  low: 1,
};
```

### Adding New Fixtures
1. Place JSON files in `public/` directory
2. Follow the `FixturePayload` interface structure
3. Update the data source selector in `app/page.tsx`

## Future Roadmap (v1.5+)

- **PDF Export**: Formatted security reports with charts
- **SIEM Integration**: Splunk, Azure Sentinel, Elastic queries
- **YAML Configuration**: Parse MCP server configs directly
- **Authentication**: User accounts and persistent storage
- **Live Scanning**: Real-time MCP server analysis
- **Advanced Analytics**: Trend analysis and historical data

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code style and patterns
2. Add tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation for API changes
4. Ensure accessibility compliance (a11y ≥ 90)
